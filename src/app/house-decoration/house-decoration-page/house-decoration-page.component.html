<p>
  Sign up and see if your neighbors believe you have the best decorated home in
  Belle Creek. The plan is to photograph each house and allow voting based on
  photos. There will never be as substitue for viewing the house in real time,
  but this will give homes a little off the beaten path a chance!
</p>
<p>
  All forms fields must be completed to submit. You can change your submission
  by re-submitting with the same email address.
</p>
<p>
  We do not need your full address, we assume you live in Belle Creek, so the
  street address is all that you need to provide to sign up. For example, the
  family center's street address is "10693 Belle Creek Blvd."
