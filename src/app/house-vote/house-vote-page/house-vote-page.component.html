<h1 class="stylized">House Decoration Contest</h1>
<p>
  Help us figure out which decorated houses are the best. Below you will find several addresses and 
  their registration number. These houses will have signs with this number on it. Vote for the house
  decorations you like the most by simply clicking on the address. You can only vote once, clicking
  a new address will change your vote! Let's keep this in the community, please don't have friends
  and family from out of the state vote. We want the best house to win, not the one with the most
  popular owner.
