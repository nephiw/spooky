<h1 class="stylized">Trunk-Or-Treat!</h1>
<p>
  The Belle Creek Charter School will be running a trunk-or-treat in the parking lot that will go from 5 to 7 pm.
  Candy will be provided for you by the school, so all you need to do is show up with a decorated car and hand out
  candy to the little gouls and goblins. There will be trophy for best decorated car or truck. So craft yourself the
  most frightening vehicle and show us what you can do.
